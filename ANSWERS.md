## 1. How much have you learned during the trial?
I learned to use ngrok and I learned about Stark API, the rest I pretty much knew already

## 2. How well does your code run? Did you create unit tests or did you leave bugs hidden in your code?
- There are no unit tests.
- Behavior was implemented based on common sense since the task was slightly vague.
- The code was tested for bugs isolating individual invoices and logging everything
- "Overdue" invoices are not handled
- No Fees are implemented
- I focused on the software engineering side of the task, there may be financial aspects missing.


## 3. How much did you rely on us to help with technical issues you face? Less is better!
I worked with full independence.

## 4. How readable and efficient is your code?
I believe it is readable and I see no major inefficiencies. This task is about system integration much more than algorithmic or low-level complexity.

## 5. How quickly did you deliver the finished task? Good code is better than quick code, but if you can score on both ends, we will be impressed.
I worked approximately 5 hours comprised of 2 one-hour sessions and 1 three-hour session. I did not rush or try for an ultra-polished deliverable since I have little free time outside of 55 weekly work hours.
